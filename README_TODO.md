## TODO before Sunday

1. ShowWorkFlowSteps procedure **Miranda**
  - #10 on the project specs
  - a procedure that outputs all the rows of the complete workflowsteps table
  - needs to be exec'd in JDBC

2. Queries on workflowsteps table **Joel**
  - #11 on the project specs
  - queries that give analysis on the workflow
  - total execution time, average execution time
  - execution time per group member and # of procedures by each member
  - the instructions say the results need to be in JTable, so they need to be exec'd in JDBC

4. Get all the procedures into the PP **Andrew, Sophie**
  - #7 in project specs
